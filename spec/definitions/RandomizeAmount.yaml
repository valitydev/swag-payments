    description: >
      Maximum deviation from original amount value.

      Generated random value shall correspond normal distribution with
      mean `deviation / 2`.  Direction of diviation is calculated
      separately.

      Thus, for value `100` with deviation of `10` half of outcomes of
      randomization are expected to be values of `95` or `105`, but
      not `100`.
