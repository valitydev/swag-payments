  deviation:
    description: >
      Maximum deviation from original amount value in minor monetary
      units.

      Generated random value shall correspond uniform distribution
      within segment `[-deviation, deviation]`.

    description: >
      Rounding of generated random value in minor monetary units of given power of `10`.

      With rounding of `2` with default `round` method generated value
      `1234` will be rounded down to `1200`.
